<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC1">Acknowledgements</A></H1>
<P>
This program would not have been possible if not for Cecchinel Stephan, whose
email address is <A HREF="mailto:interzone@pacwan.fr">interzone@pacwan.fr</A>. Some lines in <TT>`sha1sum.asm'</TT>
were taken from <TT>`md5sum.asm'</TT> and <TT>`rmdsum.asm'</TT>, both written by
Cecchinel.


<P>
I would also like to thank the <EM>ASM Utils Team</EM> and the <EM>NASM Team</EM>
for producing such fine pieces of utilities.




<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC2">Limitations</A></H1>
<P>
<CODE>sha1sum</CODE> has only been tested on an Intel Pentium 4 (32-bit) machine,
running Linux 2.4.18. This means that the maximum file size that can be
hashed is only
(2147483647) bytes. Because of this, <CODE>sha1sum</CODE> has only been optimized to
take advantage of this size limitation. It is very unlikely that <CODE>sha1sum</CODE>
can still output correct message digests of files whose sizes exceed this limit.


<P>
<TT>`sha1sum'</TT> uses the @command{bswap} instruction, which is available only
on the 486 and later Intel machines. Therefore, you need at least a 486
machine to run <TT>`sha1sum'</TT>.


<P>
Unlike <TT>`md5sum.asm'</TT> and <TT>`rmdsum.asm'</TT>, <TT>`sha1sum.asm'</TT> does not read
from STDIN; there must be at least one input file.




<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC3"><TT>`MCONFIG'</TT> Settings</A></H1>
<P>
Modifying <TT>`MCONFIG'</TT> to use <SAMP>`SYSCALL = LIBC'</SAMP> produces
<CODE>Segmentation fault</CODE>, which is otherwise absent when
<SAMP>`SYSCALL = KERNEL'</SAMP>. To correct this, <SAMP>`STARTUP = y'</SAMP> must also be set.


<P>
Setting <SAMP>`OS = FREEBSD'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`OPTIMIZE = SPEED'</SAMP> or both, does not
produce any error. Outputs from both settings are also the same.




<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC4">Print Functions</A></H1>

<PRE>
    _mov   ecx, base_N
    _mov   ebx, regSize

  _PushStack:
    xor    edx, edx
    div    ecx
    push   edx
    dec    ebx
    test   ebx, ebx
    jz     short _PopStack
    call   _PushStack

  _PopStack:
    pop    edx
    _add   edx, '0'
    cmp    edx, byte '9'
    jbe    short _PrintChar
    _add   edx, hexFormat

  _PrintChar:
    _mov   [t], edx
    sys_write STDOUT, t, 1
    ret
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>PrintNum</CODE> function prints the content of a 32-bit register in any
base representation. By default, <CODE>PrintNum</CODE> prints in hexadecimal
notation (base <CODE>16</CODE>).


<P>
The idea behind the workings of <CODE>PrintNum</CODE> is to divide the original
number by the desired base representation, and then store the resulting
remainder.
The integer part of the resulting quotient then becomes the new dividend. The
division process is repeated until the quotient becomes <CODE>0</CODE>. When
finished, the remainders are read in the reverse order that they were stored.
The remainders represent the original number printed in the desired base.


<P>
To use <CODE>PrintNum</CODE>, <CODE>eax</CODE> should already hold the number to be
printed. <CODE>eax</CODE> is the dividend, and <CODE>ecx</CODE>, which has been previously
initialized with <VAR>base_N</VAR>, is the divisor. When <CODE>eax</CODE> is divided by
<CODE>ecx</CODE>, the integer part of the resulting quotient is stored in
<CODE>eax</CODE>, overwriting its earlier content, and the remainder is stored in
<CODE>edx</CODE>. <CODE>edx</CODE> is saved by <CODE>push</CODE>-ing it in the stack (by calling
<CODE>_PushStack</CODE>). The division process is repeated until <CODE>eax</CODE> becomes
<CODE>0</CODE>, at which time, the contents of the stack are <CODE>pop</CODE>-ped off
(by calling _PopStack).


<P>
If a different representation is desired, modify the variable <VAR>base_N</VAR>.


<P>
Now, consider this. If the output should be in hexadecimal notation, 4 bits
are needed to represent one hexadecimal digit. So, a 32-bit register can
represent, at a maximum, 8 hexadecimal digits. If <CODE>PrintNum</CODE> must always
print exactly 8 digits, the call to <CODE>_PushStack</CODE> must also be done
exactly 8 times. In this case, <CODE>ebx</CODE>, which has been initialized with
<VAR>regSize</VAR>, is used as a counter for calls to <CODE>_PushStack</CODE>. By
default, <VAR>regSize</VAR> is set to <CODE>8</CODE>.


<P>
The output can also be printed in either lowercase or uppercase. The variable
<VAR>hexFormat</VAR> can be set to <CODE>0x27</CODE>, if lowercase hexadecimal notation
is desired, or to <CODE>0x07</CODE>, if the uppercase form is desired.


<P>
Also, notice that the contents of <VAR>W</VAR> are no longer needed during the
printing of the final message digest. That is why it is safe to use <VAR>t</VAR> to
also act as the last element of <VAR>W</VAR>.




<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC5"><CODE>SHA-1</CODE> Round Functions</A></H1>
<P>
The original round functions, as specified in FIPS 180-1 (Secure Hash Standard),
were replaced with their alternate forms to minimize code size. The round
functions and their alternates are as follows:


<P>
is bitwise OR,
is bitwise AND,
is bitwise exclusive OR, and
is negation. Notice that the second and fourth round functions are the same, and
hence, we can code <CODE>sha1sum</CODE> with only three round functions.



<PRE>
F0:
    _mov   ebx, [edi-16]  ; same as_mov ebx, [B]
    _mov   ecx, [edi-12]  ; same as_mov ecx, [C]
    _mov   edx, [edi-8]   ; same as_mov edx, [D]
    ret

F1:
    call   F0
    xor    ecx, edx
    and    ebx, ecx
    xor    edx, ebx       ; edx now holds result
    ret

F2:
    call   F0
    xor    edx, ecx
    xor    edx, ebx       ; edx now holds result
    ret

F3:
    call   F0
    or     ebx, ecx
    and    edx, ebx
    _mov   ebx, [edi-16]  ; revive old B
    and    ecx, ebx
    or     edx, ecx       ; edx now holds result
    ret
</PRE>

<P>
Procedure <CODE>F0</CODE> is executed first before actually executing the round
functions. <CODE>F0</CODE> uses the following trick. Before calling the round
functions, <CODE>edi</CODE> should already hold the address of <VAR>W</VAR>. Based
from the arrangement of variables in <CODE>UDATASEG</CODE>, <VAR>E</VAR> is 4 bytes
behind <VAR>W</VAR>, <VAR>D</VAR> is 8 bytes behind <VAR>W</VAR>, <VAR>C</VAR> is 12 bytes
behind <VAR>W</VAR>, and so on.




<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC6"><CODE>SHA-1</CODE> Transformation</A></H1>
<P>
<CODE>SHA1_TRANSFORM</CODE> does the bulk of the work in computing the message
digest. As in the code used for the round functions (section <A HREF="sha1sum.html#SEC5"><CODE>SHA-1</CODE> Round Functions</A>), the reference point is also <VAR>W</VAR>. The same
strategy is also employed, accessing <VAR>A</VAR>, <VAR>B</VAR>, <VAR>C</VAR>, <VAR>D</VAR>,
and <VAR>E</VAR>, solely from their offset from <VAR>W</VAR>. In addition, the
alternate method of computing the message digest, as stated in Section
8 of FIPS 180-1, is used to further cut down on code size. However, this
will likely lengthen the execution time due to the increased complexity of
address computations.




<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="sha1sum_toc.html#TOC7">Byte Orientation Issues</A></H1>

<PRE>
    call   INIT_W
    sub    edi, byte BLOCKSIZE  ; same as _mov edi, W
    _mov   ecx, BLOCKSIZE/4   ; transfer is done 4 bytes at a time
    push   eax

  BYTE_REVERSE:
    lodsd
    bswap  eax            ; store in big-endian orientation
    stosd                 ; transfer contents of buffer to W
    loop   BYTE_REVERSE
    pop    eax
    ret
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>SHA-1</CODE>, by design, favors big-endian machines. For Intel machines,
which are little-endian, it is, therefore, necessary to first reverse
the byte orientation of data to be operated on, before actually doing
any computation. The instruction @command{bswap} does the trick of converting
big-endian to little-endian orientation, and vice versa. Note, however, that
@command{bswap} is available only on the 486 and later Intel machines.
